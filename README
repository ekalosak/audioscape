# audioscape
A tiny utility to decorate your apartment with sound.
Probably better to get a playlist from your favorite streaming service instead, but I run this on an RPi for some pleasant background noise.

# requirements
python 3.7.4
depends on VLC `apt-get install vlc`
and python dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`

# usage
to run do `python play_sounds.py`
